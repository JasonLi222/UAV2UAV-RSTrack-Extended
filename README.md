# UAV2UAV-RSTrack-Extended
# Introduction
This project presents an extended and enhanced version of the UAV2UAV and RSTrack datasets, specifically designed to advance fixed-wing UAV segmentation and tracking. We augment the original datasets by introducing high-quality segmentation mask and rotated box.
